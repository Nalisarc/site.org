* Introduction

This setup aims to replace Jekyll publishing with =org-mode=, with the following requirements:

- Use as much standard packages as possible. eg. =org-publish=
- Backward compatible with my old site, which means implementing at least the permalink layout
- Ability to migrate content gradually, which means probably support Markdown posts for a while
- Ability to run it from the command line, so that CI can be used later

* Inspiration

Ideas, snippets, skeletons and more were taken from the following projects:

- Example [[http://orgmode.org][org-mode]] website using [[http://pages.gitlab.io/][GitLab Pages]] by Rasmus
- https://github.com/bastibe/org-static-blog
- [[https://gitlab.com/to1ne/blog][Toon Clae's blog]]
- The theme is a port of [[https://github.com/swanson/lagom][Lagom]]
